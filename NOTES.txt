/*
TO DO: 
move name generation into initial cell generation, and separate name generation and placing. Will help when we create stuff to redraw in-progress map
write way to determine if cell A & B are neighbors (will be used for attacks.)
begin Mongo stuffs.
Move battle calculations to the BACK end for somewhat more secure game
RE-Add socket.io (for chat!)
Should user be able to do multiple games concordantly?

where do we actually want to store cell data? in game or map model? and how?
store 'blank' version of map in map, then store just army info in game?
need TWO separate load fns: 1 to load a blank map, 1 to load game-in-progress
put each active game as it's being played in its own socketio namespace:
socket.join(mapName),
io.to(mapName).emit(someEvent)
Will need to rewrite ALL of the fight routes (i.e., cell vs cell, etc.) to use socketio namespaces.


per-game chat?
how should we handle water tiles? can players cross oceans?

WHEN does the sorting of initial armies occur? is it randomized?

Can we do private games? i.e., give game a pwd so that only players with the pwd can join?
