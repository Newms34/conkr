TO DO: 
move name generation into initial cell generation, and separate name generation and placing. Will help when we create stuff to redraw in-progress map
write way to determine if cell A & B are neighbors (will be used for attacks.)
begin Mongo stuffs.
Move battle calculations to the BACK end for somewhat more secure game
RE-Add socket.io (for chat!)
Should user be able to do multiple games concordantly?

where do we actually want to store cell data? in game or map model? and how?
store 'blank' version of map in map, then store just army info in game?
need TWO separate load fns: 1 to load a blank map, 1 to load game-in-progress
put each active game as it's being played in its own socketio namespace:
socket.join(mapName),
io.to(mapName).emit(someEvent)
Will need to rewrite ALL of the fight routes (i.e., cell vs cell, etc.) to use socketio namespaces.

per-game chat?
how should we handle water tiles? can players cross oceans?

WHEN does the sorting of initial armies occur? is it randomized?

Can we do private games? i.e., give game a pwd so that only players with the pwd can join?

CAN NOW MOVE ACROSS THE WATER!
should we delay movement(i.e., one turn "travel" time)? probly not, as not sure how i'd handle attacks

do we wanna add different 'terrains'? obv these would have different defensive/offensive bonuses. Possible land types:
mountain: no-sight, +def
plains: sight, +off
swamp: sight,+def
forest: no-sight
urban: no-sight,+off

other possible locations: cave (no vis,+def), river (slow? -def?) , village (recruit, vis, +off) 

-idea for slow effect: army gets defense penalty if defending on the turn after they moved in. slow for swamp. 
 - other next-turn effects? damage over time? possibly very smol % chance to reduce # armies by 1 (leaving at least 1 army) each turn.

effect so far: +off, +def, blind (no vis), poison, animal attacks, recruit

latitude based climate:
 percent north or south as chance for zone to be snowbound. 

WARM:		COLD:
Urban		Frozen City
Forest		Arboreal Forest
Plains		Tundra
Swamp		Frozen Swamp
Hills 		Mountain
..others?

Add resign option?
BUG FIX: if attacker loses an army, but conquers zone, num moved in should reflect this (i.e., minus the dead army)


DISASTERS:
=====
disasters should be dependent on terrain. 
most will just remove an army/armies. can they have other effects?
hide all enemy army numbers temporarily? Hide OWN army temporarily?
prevent attack? 

possibilities:
tornado - kill 1 army? kill more than 1?
flood - ?  
disease - ?
famine  - reduce army count by 1 for a turn. May need a separate var implemented for this. OR, during attack, famine reduces army number by 1 for defender.
confusion or something other (attack random neighbor?)
